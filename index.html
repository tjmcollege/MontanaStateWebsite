			<p>The state of Montana was established in 1889, but was an established territory in 1864,
			 and before that its lands were inhabited by the Crow, Cheyenne, Koontenai, Salish, and other 
			 native american tribes.</p>
			<p>Montana's land, from mountainous forests in the west and large plains 
			 in the east, have provided bountiful resources for its inhabitants. In the west the Clark Fork 
			 and Bitteroot rivers flow into the pacific-bound Columbia river, and in the east you can find 
			 the watersheds of the mighty Missouri river.</p>
			<p>The state economy in the past was focused on 
			 resource exploitation, from lumber to minerals to oil. Today the fastest growing industry is 
			 tourism as many want to experience what Montana has to offer.</p>
